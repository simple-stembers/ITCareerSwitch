README

This is a repository to hold the ITCareerSwitch tasks and projects to complete my Full Stack Development course.

There are 3 projects enclosed in this folder:

 -- Task --
   - This is a very short project to show usage of APIs, before moving on to more advanced projects.
   - Uses javascript with ajax and PHP requests to access APIs.

 -- Project 1 --
   - This project is the Gazetteer, a mobile-first web app designed to use APIs to produce information on locations around the world.
   - Uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery with server-side PHP, as well using other components, inlcuding bootstrap and leaflet.

 -- Project 2 --
   - This project is Company Directory, a web app designed to act as a personnel database management system.
   - Uses HTML, CSS, JS and MySQL to manage employee records.

Both Project 1 and Project 2 are hosted and showcased on my personal website, sdchambers.co.uk

Thanks for taking the time to check through my code!
